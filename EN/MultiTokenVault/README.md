# MultiTokenVault — English Version

## Advanced ERC-4626 Multi-Assets Vault

### Overview

Sophisticated vault simultaneously managing multiple ERC-20 tokens with automatic rebalancing strategies, integrated yield farming, and MEV protection.  
Modular architecture based on extended ERC-4626 supporting complex DeFi strategy composition with automated risk management.

### Problem Solved

- **Manual portfolio management**: Costly and inefficient rebalancing  
- **Complex yield farming**: Difficulty optimizing multi-protocol returns  
- **Liquidity fragmentation**: Capital scattered across multiple DeFi platforms  
- **Risk exposure**: Lack of diversification and automatic protection

### Technical Solution

- **Extended ERC-4626**: Vault standard with native multi-asset support  
- **Rebalancing algorithms**: Dynamic threshold-based rebalancing algorithms  
- **Strategy composition**: Modular architecture for composable DeFi strategies  
- **MEV protection**: Protection against maximal extractable value

### Key Technical Highlights

- **Multi-asset accounting**: Precise accounting with integrated Chainlink oracles  
- **Automated rebalancing**: Automatic triggering based on configurable parameters  
- **Yield optimization**: Dynamic allocation to best-performing DeFi protocols  
- **Slippage protection**: Automatic guards against trading losses  
- **Flash loan resistance**: Protection against price manipulation attacks  
- **Vault shares tokenization**: ERC-20 representing portfolio ownership

### My Role

- **Advanced ERC-4626 architecture**: Standard extension for multi-assets  
- **Rebalancing algorithms**: Rebalancing logic with adaptive thresholds  
- **Oracle integration**: Secure connection with Chainlink for real-time pricing  
- **Strategy testing**: Simulation of complex DeFi scenarios
