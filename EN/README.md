## Decentralized Medical Records Management System

### Overview

Secure blockchain system for patient records management in a private aesthetic clinic in Geneva.  
Complete solution integrating off-chain encryption, granular role-based access control, and strict GDPR compliance with comprehensive audit trail of all medical data access.

### Problem Solved

- **Medical data security**: Risky centralization of patient records  
- **GDPR compliance**: Difficulty proving consent and tracing access  
- **Interoperability**: Siloed systems without secure communication  
- **Medical audit**: Limited traceability of consultations and modifications

### Technical Solution

- **Solidity Standards**: ERC-721 + ERC721Enumerable for record tokenization  
- **OpenZeppelin Security**: AccessControl, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable  
- **Hybrid architecture**: Sensitive data encrypted off-chain; IPFS hash on-chain  
- **Access control**: Role-based system (DOCTOR, NURSE, SECRETARY, AUDITOR)

### Key Technical Highlights

- **Advanced encryption**: Patient data encrypted before IPFS storage  
- **Complete audit trail**: Traceability of all access with blockchain timestamping  
- **Emergency access**: Temporary system for critical situations  
- **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient and user-friendly error handling  
- **Indexed Events**: Advanced monitoring and analytics  
- **Complex Modifiers**: Multi-criteria validation with business logic

### My Role

- **Complete architecture**: Design of roles and permissions system  
- **Main smart contract**: Full development (14 pages of Solidity code)  
- **Blockchain security**: Implementation of advanced security patterns  
- **Unit testing**: Complete test suite for all use cases

### Status

**Proof of Concept in development — Estimated delivery Q4 2025**  
Current phase: Security testing and gas optimization
